## Setting up Peter Todd's Bitcoin Library

1. First thing to do is download the folder from Peter Todds Github Page https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib/archive/master.zip
2. You have to download the zip folder from the Github Page 
3. After installing the zip file you will need to go to file manager which is on the top left hand side 
4. Once in file manager click on Downloads that is where you have installed the unzip folder
5. Now that your in the Downloads folder scroll down and find python-bitcoinlib-master.zip 
6. Once you have found it right click on it and click extract here or go to the terminal and run this command unzip Downloads/python-bitcoinlib-master
7. Whatever way you did it you should have an unzip file called python-bitcoinlib-master in the Downloads folder
8. One of the last things to do is to go to the terminal you may already be in it if you ran the unzip command
9. Now that your in the terminal you need to navigate to the python-bitcoinlib-master folder
10. So type cd Downloads and press enter (cd stands for Change Directory) now once your in the Downloads folder enter ls (ls stands for list segments it lists all the segments in the current directory)
11. So the next thing to do is cd python-bitcoinlib-master now run ls and you will see a file called setup.py so type sudo setup.py install
12. Now you will see it installing it wont take long maybe 10-15 seconds maybe less when its finished
13. You can either type python after it has finished typing python will bring you to the python command line or they other thing to do is click on menu in the top left hand side and then to programming you dont have to click on this if you dont want to just wave your mouse over it and click python 2
14. The last thing to do is once you have either ran python in the terminal or gone to python's interface you can type import bitcoin if you get no errors you have installed it correctly
